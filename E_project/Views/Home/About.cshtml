            <h1>Why eGreetings?</h1>
            <p>The eGreetings portal aims to promote a contemporary and eco-friendly method of sharing greetings by Government officials and agencies as well as citizens to colleagues and friends for National Holidays and other national occasions. The portal allows users to select and send greetings from multiple occasion-specific templates. Government Departments can also customize the greetings by adding tag-lines and messages related to their programmes and schemes. The observance of National and International days and disseminating informational messages and greetings related to such occasions will facilitate sharing and dissemination of educational and informational content to citizens.</p>
            <p>Greetings card are an important way of communicating with colleagues and friends on special occasions and days of national importance. Sending a Greeting generates goodwill in the recipient. The erstwhile trend in the Government was to send paper Greeting-cards or use free internet-based eGreetings sites. The first option is not eco-friendly. Free internet based sites do not address the specific needs and requirements of the Greeting format, especially for government organizations.</p>
